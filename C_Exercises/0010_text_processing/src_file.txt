One of the biggest Bitcoin Exchanges, MtGox, has gone offline.The exchange has been hit by technical issues and recently halted all customer withdrawals of the digital currency after it spotted what it called "unusual activity".The move is a setback for backers of Bitcoin, who have been pushing for greater adoption of the currency.Meanwhile, six other major Bitcoin exchanges issued a joint statement distancing themselves from MtGox.The move by MtGox to halt withdrawals had resulted in a sharp decline in the value of Bitcoin.

"This tragic violation of the trust of users of MtGox was the result of one company's actions and does not reflect the resilience or value of Bitcoin and the digital currency industry," the exchanges, including Coinbase and BTC China, said in a statement."As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing today. "We are confident, however, that strong Bitcoin companies, led by highly competent teams and backed by credible investors, will continue to thrive, and to fulfil the promise that Bitcoin offers as the future of payment in the internet age," they added.Lost Bitcoins?

MTGox halted transfers of the digital currency to external addresses on 7 February.The Tokyo-based firm said it had found a loophole that thieves could use to fool the transaction process into sending double the correct number of Bitcoins. The issue also left it vulnerable to attacks, which slowed down the rate at which coins could be bought and sold.The loophole was also thought to have been exploited by thieves, who stole about $2.7m in Bitcoins from the Silk Road 2 website earlier this month.However, last week, the exchange said that customers would be able to starts withdrawals "soon".

So far, MtGox has not issued any statement about reasons behind the site going offline and whether it would be back.However, one report claimed that the exchange had become "insolvent" after losing 744,408 Bitcoins - worth about $350m (¡ê210m) at Monday's trading prices.
